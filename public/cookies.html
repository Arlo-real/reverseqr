        <h2>Why There's No Cookie Banner</h2>

        <div class="info-item">
          <h3>We Don't Use Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            ReverseQR doesn't use cookies at all. No tracking cookies, no analytics cookies, no session cookies—nothing. That's why you don't see a cookie consent banner.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-item">
          <h3>How Sessions Work Without Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of cookies, ReverseQR uses temporary session codes. When you create a session, a unique code is generated that exists only in the URL and in memory. This code is never stored in your browser's cookie storage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-item">
          <h3>Truly Temporary Sessions</h3>
          <p>
            Sessions are completely ephemeral. They exist only for the duration of your file transfer and are automatically deleted after a short period of inactivity. When you close the page or refresh, the connection is gone—there's nothing stored that could identify you later.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-item">
          <h3>No Local Storage Either</h3>
          <p>
            We don't use localStorage, sessionStorage, or IndexedDB to persist any data. Your encryption keys are generated fresh for each session and exist only in memory while the page is open.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-item">
          <h3>Privacy by Design</h3>
          <p>
            This cookie-free approach is part of our commitment to privacy. By not using cookies or any persistent client-side storage, we ensure that there's no trace of your activity left on your device after you're done using ReverseQR. (except in browser history)
