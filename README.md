# ReverseQR - Secure File & Text Sharing

A web application for sharing files and text between two devices without account or previous contact.
Try it [here](https://reverseqr.qzz.io/) (uptime not guaranteed)

## Why I did this
When I use a PC I do not trust (like a school PC with an outdated version of Windows and a disabled antivirus (for some reason I still have not figured out)) I do not want to plug in any USB stick or open my password manager, which is problematic since my passwords are 10+ characters long and randomly generated. I often resolve to typing them by hand, which is annoying.
Now, I can simply open up this website and scan the QR code to transfer anything from my phone to the PC.

## Features

### Security
- **End-to-end encryption**: The server does not see what is being send (only the size)
- **No Data Retention**: Files get deleted shortly after upload (default: 30 minutes)

### Privacy
- No user tracking (no cookies, no browser fingerprinting, no nothing)
- Sessions expire after a short amount of time (15 min by default)
- All data deleted shortly after upload (30 min by default)

### Easy use: two way of transmitting the connection code
- **QR Code**: Receiver displays QR code, sender scans it
- **Human-Readable Codes**: PGP wordlist encoding for easy verbal transmission

### A simple but powerful tool:
- Text Message and File transfer 
- A sleek, Modern, responsive web interface
- No installation or configuration required by clients (all in browser)


## Limitations
- High RAM usage for the sender and receiver
- A malicious server admin could replace the normal webpage with one that does not encrypt the data and the user would not be able to notice



## How to use?

**For Receiver:**
1. Open http://localhost:3000/
2. Share the QR code or PGP-encoded connection code with sender
3. Files/messages appear automatically when sent

**For Sender:**
1. Scan QR code or open /sender page and enter connection code
2. Type message and/or upload files
3. Click "Send Securely"
4. Receiver gets the messages



## Encryption Details

### Key Exchange
1. Both parties generate DH key pairs
2. Public keys are exchanged via the server
3. Shared secret is computed locally
4. Encryption key is derived using HKDF-SHA256

### Message Encryption
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Size**: 256 bits
- **IV**: 16 random bytes per message
- **3 word code** derived from encryption key to spot man in the middle attacks


## Deployment:


### Quick Start (for testing with localhost)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Reverseqr uses the crypto.sublte in the browser, which is only available in a secure context (localhost or https) therefore, the whole app will not work correctly if this is not the case (for example when testing using a second device on the same network).
In such conditions, the page will load, but not display any QR code or connection code and not permit any data transfer. This however indicates that the server is working fine.

### Installation

1. **Clone and navigate to project:**
```bash
cd reverseqr/
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the server:**

```

4. **Access the application:**
- Receiver: http://localhost:3000 (by default)
- Sender: http://localhost:3000/sender (by default)



### Production with Nginx
